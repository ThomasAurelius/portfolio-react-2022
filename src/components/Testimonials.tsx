							&ldquo;I already had a couple of sites built that I needed
							merged under one business name and website. Thomas took my
							sites, colors, logo, etc. and merged them together
							beautifully in one, simple to use website. He listened to
							my needs and even suggested other web hosts, appointment
							apps, etc. that would work for my intended purpose. He was
							extremely patient with my long response times as I was also
							going through a tough personal matter at the time. He was
							open and asked for honest feedback every step of the way. I
							could easily share what I liked and didn't like without
							fear of offending. He truly cares that you're happy with
							his work and your website. He was also dependable and
							affordable for a micro business such as myself. Thanks
							again Thomas!&rdquo;
